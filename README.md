# serverModpack_v2
New and improved version of the original server modpack

!!! I still do NOT own any of these mods and they were found on curseforge ( https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods ) !!!

Modpack has been reset to version 1.12.2 for compatibality reasons.
The recommended Shader is Vanilla Plus (can be found at https://rre36.github.io/vplus_web/2020-05-18-vplus_2.2/)
The 'mods' folder contains mods that form the 'core' of the modpack while the 'mods_under_review' folder contains
additional mods which have to be approved
